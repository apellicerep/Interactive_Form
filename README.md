# Interactive Form

In this project, I used JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form.

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, I added ALL the JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

* adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
* validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
* Instead of plain "vanilla" JavaScript, I used the popular jQuery library to complete this project to get familiar with this library since it is so common and prevalent on the web.
